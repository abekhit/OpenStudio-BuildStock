Installation
############

Install OpenStudio and PAT
==========================

Download the latest stable software version of OpenStudio (2.7.0) from the `OpenStudio developer website <https://www.openstudio.net/developers>`_.
This is necessary because the latest critical changes to run ResStock projects are only available in the latest version.
Do a default install including Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT). 

Open the Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT). You may be asked if you would like to allow openstudio to allow connections. Select "Allow".
